Chapter 3: Research Methodology
3.1 Introduction
This chapter presents the comprehensive methodology adopted to investigate the structural reliability of timber roof trusses under fire exposure. The research methodology integrates experimental characterization of material properties, fire performance testing, and probabilistic reliability analysis using Monte Carlo Simulation. The chapter is structured to provide a detailed account of the experimental procedures, analytical models, and computational frameworks employed to achieve the research objectives outlined in Section 1.4.
The methodology focuses specifically on the identification, formulation, and probabilistic assessment of critical failure modes in timber truss members—namely the top chord, bottom chord, and web members—under standard and parametric fire exposures. Connections are excluded from this investigation as per the scope defined in Section 1.5.1.

Based on an extensive literature review and preliminary structural analysis, the failure modes investigated in this study are classified into three categories corresponding to the principal truss members:
Table 3.1: Classification of Failure Modes by Member Type
3.3.2 Theoretical Basis for Failure Mode Formulation
The limit state design philosophy adopted in Eurocode 5 forms the theoretical foundation for failure mode formulation. For each failure mode, a limit state function is established in the general form:

3.4 Failure Mode 1: Top Chord Compression Buckling
3.4.1 Description of Failure Mechanism
The top chord of a timber truss is subjected to compressive forces from roof loads. Under fire exposure, charring reduces the cross-sectional area, increasing the slenderness ratio and reducing the buckling resistance. Compression buckling occurs when the critical buckling load is exceeded, leading to sudden lateral deflection and structural collapse.

3.18 Summary
This chapter has presented a comprehensive methodology for investigating eight distinct failure modes in timber roof trusses under fire exposure:
Top Chord Compression Buckling (FM1)
Top Chord Combined Bending and Compression (FM2)
Bottom Chord Tension Rupture (FM3)
Bottom Chord Bending (FM4)
Bottom Chord Lateral Torsional Buckling (FM5)
Web Member Compression Buckling (FM6)
Web Member Tension Rupture (FM7)
Shear Failure in All Members (FM8)
For each failure mode, explicit limit state functions have been formulated (Eqns. 3.3-3.61), random variables defined (Eqns. 3.68-3.77), and correlation structures established (Eqns. 3.78-3.82). The Monte Carlo simulation framework (Section 3.15.3) enables probabilistic assessment of failure probabilities and reliability indices for each mode, while sensitivity analysis (Section 3.16) identifies the most critical parameters governing truss performance under fire.
The methodology integrates experimental data from material characterization and fire tests with advanced probabilistic modeling, providing a robust framework for evaluating the fire reliability of Nigerian timber species (Anogeissus leiocarpa and Erythrophleum suaveolens) in roof truss applications.

4.17.2 Required Lateral Restraints
Table 4.16: Lateral Restraint Requirements for R30
4.17.3 Critical Observations for 6 m Span
Shear (FM8) governs member sizing for both species, requiring increased web dimensions.
E. suaveolens (R) performs adequately with 75 × 150 mm web members and lateral restraints at 750 mm spacing.
A. leiocarpa (W) requires larger web members (100 × 150 mm) due to its lower shear strength (1.52 N/mm²).
Weak-axis buckling (FM1, FM3) is critical for A. leiocarpa, requiring either closer lateral restraint spacing or increased member dimensions.
Lateral torsional buckling (FM6) is satisfied for both species with mid-span restraint of the bottom chord.
The governing fire resistance time for the 6 m span truss with appropriately sized members exceeds the R30 requirement.

4.18 Conclusion
The deterministic Eurocode 5 fire design for a 6 m span timber truss demonstrates that with appropriate member sizing and lateral restraints, the truss achieves the required R30 fire resistance. All eight failure modes (FM1 through FM8) have been verified using experimentally derived material properties for both Nigerian hardwood species.
Erythrophleum suaveolens (R) performs satisfactorily with web members of 75 × 150 mm and lateral restraints at 750 mm spacing. Anogeissus leiocarpa (W) requires larger web members of 100 × 150 mm and closer lateral restraint spacing due to its lower characteristic strengths, particularly in shear (1.52 N/mm²) and compression (10.2 N/mm²).
Shear (FM8) is the most critical failure mode governing member sizing for both species. These findings confirm that for shorter spans, timber trusses can achieve adequate fire resistance without extensive fire protection, provided that member sizing and lateral restraint requirements are properly addressed based on species-specific material properties.
